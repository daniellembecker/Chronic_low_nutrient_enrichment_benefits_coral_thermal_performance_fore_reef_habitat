**Contents:** There are eight folders and a README.md file.

**Folders:**

**[Bioinformatics](Bioinformatics)**    
Contains data, output, and script files to compare the Symbiodiniaceae relative abundances in ITS2 profiles from *Pocillopora* spp. fragments at the control and nutrient-enriched treatments (n = 16) on the fore reef on the north shore of Mo'orea, French Polynesia.

**[Endosymbiont_Coral_Response](Endosymbiont_Coral_Response)**          
Contains data, output, and script files to calculate and analyze the effect of the chronic nutrient-enriched treatment on each coral, and endosymbiont response variable

**[HOBO](HOBO)**  
Contains data, output, and script files to create a map of Mo'orea showing detailed information on the nutrient and sediment regime at each of our sampling sites. The data is represented by the average percent nitrogen content in *Turbinaria ornata* (macroalgal species) samples and sedimentation rates at each site.

**[Map](Map)**  
Contains output, and script files to create a map of the north shore fore reef nutrient-enriched and control treatment sites in Mo'orea.

**[PI_curve](PI_curve)**  
Contains data, output, and script files to characterize a net photosynthesis as a function of photon flux density (commonly referred to as photosynthesis-irradiance (PI)) curve and analyze the saturating light levels for the experimental coral samples collected and sampled at the nutrient-enriched and control treatments. 

**[Respirometry](Respirometry)**  
Contains data, output, and script files with all the raw respirometry files from the PreSens output, files for the raw output of the respirometry rates from the LoLinR package, and R script to take raw respirometry data and calculate photosynthesis and respiration rates.

**[Thermal_Performance](Thermal_Performance)**  
Contains data, output, and script files to characterize and analyze thermal performance curve (TPC) metrics. Contains all the plotted TPC curves by each treatment and by each metabolic rate process (photosynthesis and respiration) per coral sample.
